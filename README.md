# Android Maps Application 

## Overview

This is a simple Android application that integrates Google Maps using the Google Maps SDK for Android.  
It loads a map fragment, adds a marker near the Coursera office in Mountain View, California, and positions the camera on the marker.  
The project is designed to help learners understand how to implement interactive maps in Android using `SupportMapFragment`.
